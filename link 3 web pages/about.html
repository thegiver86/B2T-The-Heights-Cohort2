			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I recognize the long road ahead and can see the cross-roads and intricate details that which will help me construct my desires, or manifest my downfall. I want to build myself with certain necessary skills that I can use to my advantage later in the future. I want to own my own business, with all my ideas floating around. Learning web development now will make me much more versatile later when trying to lift my venture off the ground. It will allow me to be more interactive with the presentation of my business. When can I do it is an interesting question. I could technically start now, but there are certain milestones I believe I have to reach first. There are a lot of things I’ve yet to learn. I’m planning to start my venture Online, and network/market in school. I'm still brainstorming and tweaking ideas everyday in hopes that one day ONE of all those thoughts will inspire me to create a new trend.</p>
