		<h5>Student at University at Buffalo | Aspiring Entreprenuer | Future Web Developer</h5>
		<hr>

		<p>
			We plant the seeds of our future in our dreams, which then become desires and ambitions. I've always been fascinated with the feeling of a successful sale, and the intricate planning of it all. The ideas of what could make people tick or bring them together. I plan on graduating with a B.A in business administration, because I want to know how the inner clockwork of a business works. Web development will allow me to be a part of birthing ideas as well as creating my own. My end goal is to create a business that will change my lifestyle to the one I desire.
